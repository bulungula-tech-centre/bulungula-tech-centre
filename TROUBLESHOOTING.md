| Pi not network booting                                                | - Determine whether there is a device acting as the DHCP server. If there is no DHCP server (an example of this is if you do not have a router connected to the Pis -- the router generally acts as the DHCP server), you will need to configure piserver to act as the DHCP server. Piserver has to be configured to assign IP addresses to the clients when they boot. Go to settings on the piserver application, and select "Act as a standalone DHCP server". <br>- Plug in the ethernet cable to Pi before supplying power for boot. <br>- Check whether new IP addresses have been allocated to the server and/or Pis. New IPs might have been assigned when the server restarted if the server wasn’t connected to the router. <br>- Take out keyboard and/or mouse (seemed to only be a mac keyboard though) when booting. |
| All the Pis are frozen (only mouse moves)                             | The local network is disconnected. <br>- Perhaps the server is off? When the server is turned back on, the Pis should continue where you left off <br>- Connection to server is broken. Check the light at the switch for whether it is on for the server. If it is not, check whether the server’s ethernet cable is connected correctly to the server and/or switch. If that doesn’t work, the ethernet cable might need to be replaced. When the connection to the server is restored, the Pis should continue where you left off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Only one Pi is frozen (only mouse moves)                              | The Pi could be disconnected from the local network.  <br>- Check the LED at the switch to see if it is communicating with the Pi. If it is not, check if the ethernet cable for that Pi is connected correctly to the Pi and/or the switch correctly. If they are connected correctly and it still doesn’t resolve the problem, the ethernet cable might need to be replaced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Pi will not boot (but is has booted previously)                       | - Check if the router is disconnected (look at the router’s LED on the switch). Connect the router. Plug the power supplies into the Pis again.  <br>- The Pi was “shutdown”.

| Pi3B won't network boot                                               | - Pi 3Bs don’t network boot as easily as 3B+s. This is because their boot firmware is out of date. One can work around this by loading the up-to-date boot file onto a blank SD card and inserting it into the Pi 3B. Note the SD card should have nothing on it except the boot file. See this github issue to download the boot file and get more info on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/piserver/issues/40).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
