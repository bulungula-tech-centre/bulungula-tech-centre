excerpt: "This website contains the instructions to replicate the low-cost, low-power computer lab we built at the Bulungula College, a school in rural South Africa. Our goal was to use free and open-source software to make this solution as accessible as possible."

The Bulungula Tech Centre was created as a model to bridge the technological gap in rural South Africa. Using cost-effective, energy-efficient and open-source technologies, the Bulungula Tech Centre provides access to computers and the internet for youth in five villages in the rural Eastern Cape. This website is a knowledge repository of how we set about creating the centre to help others replicate the process in their own communities.
