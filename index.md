excerpt: "Tech center is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the ball rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it."

This website contains the instructions to replicate the low-cost, low-power computer lab we built at the Bulungula College, a school in rural South Africa. Our goal was to use free and open-source software to make this solution as accessible as possible. Please see our [GitHub Pages Site](https://jcformanek.github.io/bulungula-tech-center/) for more about the project's motivation and context.
